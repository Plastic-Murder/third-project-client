# Xobpord

## Description

This application is a Dive log application client.  In combination with the Dive log application server, the app allows users to create an account then log in to keep track and maintain a dive log.  The user, once log in can change passwords, add, delete, edit and look at all the dives that they have logged.


## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- handlebars
- Ruby on Rails

## Next Version

- add more fields for user inputs
- styling
- involve 3rd party API where weather data can automatically populate the log once location and date is entered

## Planning

The process stared with planning a user story and ERD, then the wireframe just falls into place.  The user authentication was created first follow by the backend API, and making sure that the relationship exist between the users and the dive logs.  After all of that is set up, some time was allocated to styling the website.  Future versions will have a lot more input fields and the option to pull in weather information from a 3rd party API based on location and date entered.  Lack of experience with bootstrap modal made it challenging to incoorporate and utilize but the documentations were helpful.
